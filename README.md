## Introduction to the Robot and its Objective:
In an era of technological advancement and commerce, warehouse management has become one of the most marginalized and evolving areas. One of the most captivating developments in this regard is the introduction of warehouse robots, which have emerged as representatives
of technological advancement in this field. These intelligent devices, utilizing artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things, and advanced sensors, have evolved into a powerful combination of intelligence, precision, and speed.

## Advantages of a Warehouse Robot:
1. Increased Productivity:
Warehouse robots, with their intelligent capabilities, have enhanced the productivity of various warehouse processes. This increase in productivity not only reduces the time and costs associated with warehouse operations but also increases the ability to perform tasks simultaneously and more quickly.
2. High Precision:
Warehouse robots, utilizing barcode scanning technology and sensors, exhibit high precision in identifying and recording products. This precision reduces human errors in inventory management and order fulfillment.
3. Cost Reduction:
Increased productivity and precision lead to a reduction in operational costs associated with warehouse management. Robots play a significant role as the primary driver of business efficiency improvement.
4. Technological Transformation in Warehouse Management:
Technologies such as artificial intelligence, the Internet of Things (IoT), and machine learning have gradually entered the field of warehouse management. These advancements greatly facilitate the optimization of warehouse processes. Smart warehouses, with the ability to connect to other networks and exchange data, enable better inventory management, demand forecasting, and waste reduction. As a significant advancement in supply chain management, these technological transformations signify a bright future for improving warehouse processes and enhancing efficiency in organizations. Warehouse robots, with all their capabilities, symbolize the endless potential of technology in enhancing the efficiency and performance of modern warehouses.

## Introduction to the Functions of the Warehouse Robot:
Our team has devoted considerable effort and dedication to building an advanced version of the warehouse robot, which not only meets the basic needs of a warehouse and warehouse manager but also assists warehouse operators in intelligently and optimally managing the status of goods, inventory, and robot operation processes by upgrading warehouse processes.

## Main Objective of the Project:
The main objective of building this robot is to facilitate warehouse processes. As an intelligent collaborator, this robot is capable of performing tasks such as automatic or manual movement of boxes and loads. Additionally, this project has provided a mobile application that warehouse operators can easily use to communicate with the robot and monitor its operation status.

## Primary Functions of the Warehouse Robot:

1. Moving Loads: The warehouse robot is capable
of automatically or manually moving boxes and
loads. This feature helps warehouse operators
quickly and efficiently transport loads to their
intended destinations.

2. Inventory Checking: Using sensors and
advanced technologies, the robot can check the
inventory in the warehouse and provide
warehouse operators with accurate information
about the status of products in stock.

3. Warehouse Temperature Control: The robot has
the ability to control the temperature in the
warehouse and can assist in adjusting the
ambient temperature if necessary.

4. Warehouse Humidity Control: By using a
humidity control system, the warehouse robot
provides the capability to manage and monitor
the humidity level in the environment.

5. Smoke Detection Alert: Equipped with smoke
sensors, the warehouse robot can send an alert
to the mobile application or notify the warehouse
operators in case of smoke detection.

This initial version of the warehouse
robot is designed to address the basic
needs of a warehouse and warehouse
manager. With the continuation of the
project and the development of the
robot, it is expected that by adding
features and necessary improvements, it
will evolve into a smarter and more
efficient tool. This version is just the first
step towards improving warehouse
processes and our team will be diligently
working with full energy to advance the
project and further enhance the robot's
functionality and usability.

## Designing and constructing the power management:

1. First, we print the circuit diagram of the power
management on a glass-coated paper with
dimensions of 10*10
2. Then, we scratch the fiberglass with a wire and
print the circuit diagram onto the fiberglass using
an iron. To ensure better adhesion of the paper
onto the fiberglass, it's better to first heat the
surface with the iron. The more pressure applied
by the iron onto the fiberglass, the better the ink
will adhere to it.
3. Afterward, to separate the paper, we
immerse the fiberglass in water and peel off
the paper. Following the separation of the
papers, we soak the fiberglass in tea acid to
ensure that only the circuit design remains
on it.
4. After separating the papers, we immerse the
fiberglass in tea acid so that only the circuit
the design remains on it.
5. After that, we place the components on the board
using a regular drill with a 1mm drill bit and solder
the components onto the board. Soldering starts
with low-profile components like resistors or diodes
and ends with components like Tip2259. If your
board is bone-shaped, use a 40w soldering iron. For
components requiring heat sinking like Tip2259, first,
connect the heat sink to the component and then
the solder.

## Sensors:
In building this robot, we have used
three sensors: DHT11, MQ2, and ultrasonic. You can see how we program sensors and the codes on this repository.
We used DC gearbox motors. Initially, we measured the
current by applying pressure to the pulling motor using a
power source. Then, after connecting the wheels to the
motor, we supplied input to the L298 and noted the
wheel rotation direction by giving manual flags.

# Body construction and component placement
In the design and development of a warehouse robot, careful consideration of body construction and component placement is crucial for ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and safety. Below is a detailed overview of best practices in these areas, particularly relevant for a first-time robot project.

Body Construction
1. Durability and Robustness:

Materials: Select high-strength, lightweight materials such as aluminum alloys or reinforced plastics for the robot's body. These materials balance durability with weight considerations, enabling the robot to withstand impacts and operate reliably in a demanding warehouse environment.
Design Reinforcements: Identify and reinforce areas of the robot that are most susceptible to wear and tear, such as corners and edges. This helps minimize damage from accidental collisions and prolongs the robot’s lifespan.
2. Size and Shape:

Dimensions: Design the robot with dimensions that allow it to navigate standard warehouse aisles and spaces. Ensure the robot is compact enough to maneuver through narrow passages but large enough to handle typical cargo sizes.
Shape: Opt for a low center of gravity to enhance stability and prevent tipping. A streamlined shape reduces the risk of getting stuck or caught on obstacles.
3. Mobility:

Wheels vs. Tracks: Choose between wheels or tracks based on the warehouse floor conditions. Wheels are suitable for smooth surfaces, while tracks are better for uneven or rough terrain. Consider advanced options like omni-wheels or mecanum wheels for enhanced maneuverability.
Suspension System: Incorporate a suspension system if the robot needs to navigate uneven floors. This feature helps maintain stability and ensures smoother operation across different surface types.
Component Placement
1. Sensors and Cameras:

Strategic Placement: Position sensors and cameras at key locations such as the front, sides, and top of the robot. This setup provides comprehensive coverage for obstacle detection, navigation, and item recognition.
Types of Sensors: Utilize a combination of LIDAR, ultrasonic sensors, and cameras to achieve accurate environmental mapping and reliable object detection.
2. Manipulators:

Location and Reach: Place manipulators (arms, grippers) to maximize their range and flexibility. Ensure that they can effectively handle items from various positions and heights within the robot’s operational area.
Design and Tools: Equip manipulators with suitable tools or grippers designed for specific tasks, such as lifting boxes or handling pallets.

## How to run:
Make sure you have `python` installed on your system. Instal the required dependency by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your terminal.
